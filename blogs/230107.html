      <h2>
        how i thought about 2022: <br>
        well it went ok but i feel like i didnt grow as much as i could and i didnt go out to 
        reach for opportunities that i did previously, but i did have a really good period after 
        cosmos bc that really motivated me to learn bc the enviro there was pretty competitive
        and everyone was really eager to learn, but i lost that as soon as i came back to reality 
        and public school <br><br>
        anyway, im hoping to become that girl in 2023 so ill j leave 2022 behind now :)
